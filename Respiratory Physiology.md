# Respiratory Physiology
## 1. Structure and Function
How the architecture of the lung sub-serves its function
### Blood-Gas Interface
- Extremely thin (0.2-0.3 μm)
- Enormous surface area of 50 to 100 m^2^
- Large area obtained by having about 500 million alveoli
- So thin that large increases in capillary pressure can damage the barrier
### Airways and Airflow
- Divided into a conducting zone and a respiratory zone.
- Volume of the anatomic dead space is around 150 ml.
- Volume of the alveolar region is about 2.5-3 liters.
- Gas movement in the alveolar region is chiefly by diffusion.
### Blood Vessels and Flow
- The whole of the output of the right heart goes to the lung
- The diameter of the capillaries is about 7 to 10 μm
- The thickness of much of the capillary walls is less than 0.3 μm
- Blood spends around 0.75 second in the capillaries
### Stability of Alveoli
- Surfactant dramatically lowers the surface tension of the alveolar lining layer, and increases alveolar stability.

## 2. Ventilation
How gas gets to the alveoli
### Lung Volumes
- Tial volume and vital capacity can be measures with a simple spirometer
- Total Lung Capacity, functional residual capacity, and residual volume need an additional measurement by helium dilution or the body plethysmograph
- Helium is used because of its very low dolubility in blood
- The use of body plethysmograph depends on Bolye's law, PV = k, at constant temperature
### Minute Ventilation
- Total ventilation is tidal volume x respiratory frequency
- Alveolar ventilation is the amount of fresh gas getting to the alveoli, or (V~T~ - V~D~) x n
### Dead Space
- Anatomic dead space is the volume of the conducting airways, about 150 ml
- Physiologic dead space is the volume of gas that does not eliminate CO~2~
- The two dead spaces are almost the same in normal subjects, but the physiologic dead space is increased in many lung diseases
### Regional Differences in Ventilation
- The lower regions of the lung are better ventilated than the upper regions because of the effects of gravity on the lungs

## 3. Diffusion
How gas gets across the blood-gas barrier
### Fick's Law of Diffusion
- The rate of diffusion of a gas through a tissue slice is proportional to the area but inversely proportional to the thickness
- Diffusion rate is proportional to the partial pressure difference
- Diffusion rate is proportional to the solubility of the gas in the tissue but inversely proportional to the square root of the molecular weight
### Diffusion and Perfusion Limitations
- CO is diffusion-limited
- NO is perfusion-limited
- Oxygen transfer is normally perfusion limited, but some diffusion limilation may occur under some conditions, including intense exercise, thickening of the blood-gas barrier, annd alveolar hypoxia.
- Carbon dioxide transfer across the blood-gas barrier is probably not diffusion-limited.
### Measurement of Diffusing Capacity
- Carbon monoxide is used because the uptake of this gas is diffusion limited
- Normal diffusing capacity is about 25 ml per min per mm Hg
- Diffusing capacity increases with exercise
### Reaction Rates with Hemoglobin
- The reaction rate of oxygen is fast, but because so little time is available in the capillary, this rate can become a limiting factor
- The resistance to the update of oxygen attributable to reaction rate is probably about the same as that due to diffusion across the blood-gas barrier
- The reaction rate of CO can be altered by changing the alveolar P~O2~

## 4. Perfusion and Blood Flow
How the pulmonary circulation removes gas from the lung, and alter some metabolites
### Pressures within Pulmonary Blood Vessels


## 5. Ventilation-Perfusion Relationships
How matching of gas and blood determines gas exchange
### Oxygen Transport from Air to Tissues
- The four causes of hypoxemia are hypoventilation, diffusion limitation, shunt, and ventilation-perfusion inequality
- The two causes of hypercapnia are hypoventilation, and ventilation-perfusion inequality.
### Hypoventilation
- Always increased the alveolar and arterial P~CO2~
- Decreased the P~O2~ unless additional oxygen is inspired
- Hypoxemia is easy to reverse by adding oxygen to the inspired gas
- The alveolar ventilation equations
$$P_{CO2} = \frac{V_{CO2}}{V_{A}} \times K
$$ where V~CO2~ is the CO~2~ production, and V~A~ is the alevolar ventilation, and 
$$ PA_{O2} = PI_{O2} - \frac{PA_{CO2} }{R} + F$$ where F is a small correction factor, and R is around 0.8.
### Diffusion
### Shunt
