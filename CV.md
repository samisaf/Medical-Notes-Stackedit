## Computer Programs and Software
- **AKI Calculator** - A program that analyzes a series of creatinine laboratory values extracted from the EMR, and calculates if the patient had an AKI episode
- **Charlson Score Calculator** - A program that processes ICD9 codes extracted from the EMR, and produces a Charlson comorbidity table along with a calculated Charlson score.
-  **Renal Ultrasound Database** - A database that was developed to be a repository of all internal renal ultrasounds done by nephrology fellows/trainees.
- **Mechanical Waveform simulation** - A simulation program that allows the learner to experiment with various modes of mechanical ventilation.
